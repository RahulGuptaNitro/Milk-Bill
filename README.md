### Description
Built an app to calculate the bill of milk purchased. Built it using Flutter in which I integrated a calendar and on each date a person can store quantity of milk and it automatically marks the date and one can generate bill whenever they want. It is an offline app without using third party database.

Dependencies used:
```
table_calendar
shared_preferences
```
